This is part 4 of the 4-part series to introduce Share Virtual Address
(SVA) support for devices, which can support PCI ATS, PASID and PRI
capabilities. These devices are referred to as SVA-capable devices in
this series.

It contains the following enhancements:

* Patch 1 - 3:
  Rename, add support to enable/disable features, update DTE etc.

* Patch 4 - 10:
  Add IOPF support

* Patch 11 - 14:

This patch series is based on top of SVA Part 3 v4.

Thanks everyone who reviewed previous version and provided valuable feedbacks.

Changes from v3 -> v4:

  - Added patch to fix PPR interrupt processing logic
  - Renamed enable_iommus_v2() -> enable_iommus_ppr()
  - Added ops->domain_alloc_sva()
  - Added domain_alloc_sva() support and reorganize SVA patches
  - In error path iommu_call_iopf_notifier() calls amd_iommu_complete_ppr()
    instead of amd_iommu_page_response()
