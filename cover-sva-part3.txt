iommu/amd: SVA Support (part 3) - refactor support for GCR3 table

This is part 3 of the 4-part series to introduce Share Virtual
Address (SVA) support, which focuses on refactoring GCR3 table.
This moves GCR3 related information from protection domain
structure to iommu_dev_data (per device) structure.

It contains the following enhancements:

* Patch 1 - 3:
  Cleanup and introduce helper function

* Patch 4 - 13:
  Introduce per device GCR3 table, per device domain ID, invalidation based
  on per device and code refactoring

* Patch 14 - 16:
  Remove unused variable, rearrange functions to make it easy to maintain

This patch series is based on top of iommu/next branch (commit bd19c7637024).

Thanks Jason for reviewing previous versions and providing valuable feedbacks.

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20231212085224.6985-1-vasant.hegde@amd.com/T/#t

Changes from v3 -> v4:
  - Added new patch to enable IOMMU GT feature early
  - Fixed dirty tracking path to use get_amd_iommu_from_dev()
  - Fixed duplicate flush issue in do_attach() path
  - Removed gcr3_info->giov variable. Instead we use domain page table mode to decide
    DTE[GIOV] bit.
  - Free gcr3_table before calling set_dte_entry (otherwise there is a possibility
    of its setting up gcr3 table with glx 0)
  - Adjusted gfp_t flag for GCR3 table allocation (GPF_ATOMIC -> GFP_KERNEL)
  - Moved below patches from invalidation improvement series to this series
    * Remove unused flush_pasid() related functions
      (Originally it was part of Invalidation improvement series, I had to push it to
       this series as set_gcr3() was still using __amd_iommu_flush_tlb()).
    * Added patch to Rearrange device flush code

v3 : https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20231013151652.6008-1-vasant.hegde@amd.com/T/#t

Changes from v2 -> v3:
  - Dropped "iommu/amd: Use struct protection_domain in helper functions" as flush related
    functions are already fixed and set_gcr3 related functions is reworked in this series.
  - Removed moving to_pdomain() function from this series. It will be introduced
    in SVA series where it will be used.
  - Added per device domain ID and per device invalidation functions
  - Added functions to flush TLB for the given device
  - Added Review-by tags

v2 : https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20230816174031.634453-1-vasant.hegde@amd.com/T/#t

Changes from v1 - v2:
  - Dropped iommu_v2 module related support as newly introduced Part2
    removed iommu_v2 module.
  - Moved Patch 'Use struct protection_domain in helper functions' from Part1 to
    Part3
  - Updated get_amd_iommu_from_dev() to retrieve iommu from device structure
  - Removed 'PD_MODE_PT'

v1 : https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20230808100232.5977-1-vasant.hegde@amd.com/T/#t
